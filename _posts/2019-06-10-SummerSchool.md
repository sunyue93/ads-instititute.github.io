The ADSI faculty are pleased to announce the development of a summer school that aims to promote discussion and collaboration within several research areas at the core of algorithmic data science. The ADSI Summer School on the Foundations of Data Science, jointly organized with [IFDS](https://ifds.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is organized around a lecture series emphasizing topics in optimization, computation, and learning theory that lie at the foundation of modern machine learning. The program includes both ADSI faculty and distinguished invited speakers. 

The summer school will feature opportunities for discussion and collaboration between participants, as well as a venue for students to share their own work. More details, including application information, can be found on the summer school [website](https://alecgt.github.io/adsi_summer/). The organizers encourage all interested students or researchers to apply.

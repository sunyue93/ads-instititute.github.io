ADSI is co-organizing a workshop with the University of Wisconsin's Institute for the Foundations of Data Science. It aims to explore nonconvex problems arising in data science, their key properties, and current bottlenecks in solving them, and develop algorithms to solve them. The target audience includes people from mathematics, statistics, and computer science, with an interest in nonconvex optimization. The workshop will also feature invited presentations, open problem sessions, and panel discussions.  The workshop takes place July 30-August 1, 2018 at the University of Wisconsin, Madison; for more information, please visit the [website](https://ifds.wisc.edu/workshops/nonconvex-formulations/).
